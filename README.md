android-floating-action-button
==============================
This branch is showing one version of the main activity to SDK 21 devices and another Activity, with a backward compatible,
animated floating action button to devices running any SDK before Android L, v.21.

The backward version has an xml animation. It is stacked on top of a text view (could be anything) by being last in a Relative Layout.
Run it and see.
