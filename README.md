android-floating-action-button
==============================
This branch is a stretch from the previous code, build on Android 20. The sample from Google built from a FrameLayout is found alongside the Applico version that is built from an ImageView. The FabView now changes color when selected, in addition to the spinning star animation. The affordance graphics are a favorites star and a check.

The Google example has a ripple rotation and a color change when going from selected/checked to unselected. The graphics are plus and check. The radius is changed in the Google example such that two FAB's show on the screen.

It's all Android 21 now. Run it and pick your fave.
